      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I feel like imposter syndrome is a big issue that everyone has dealt with, especially in the Tech Industry, especially seeing how many materials are open to everyone on the internet, and all the resources. I&rsquo;ve certainly felt that way before, and I still do on a day to day occasion. I feel like I&rsquo;m not good enough at Programming, and I feel like with all the time I&rsquo;ve devoted to it I&rsquo;m still trash at it. However, one thing I&rsquo;ve come to realize is that, I won&rsquo;t ever know everything in programming. It&rsquo;s simply impossible, there are new technologies coming out all the time everyday all over the world, it&rsquo;s evolving at an extremely fast pace, and that&rsquo;s the truth of it. There are a lot of misconceptions about being a programmer, about how you&rsquo;re expected to be a super smart person, and how you need to know everything about what you do, but that&rsquo;s just impossible. There are too many specific functions/libraries for something, and we&rsquo;ll all need to read up on some documentation or look at examples to understand how something works. I think the most important thing that one needs to realize first is that you don&rsquo;t know everything. So when you&rsquo;re trying to do something, and you can&rsquo;t figure out, looking through the documentation for the tool you&rsquo;re using is something you shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed of. Instead, I would embrace it, because you realize that you&rsquo;re not knowledgeable about something, and instead of crying about not knowing something, you&rsquo;re taking the initiative to learn it. Having a growth mindset is the best way to learn, always being open to learn new things, and when you don&rsquo;t know something, don&rsquo;t get bummed out by it.  No one knows everything, so don&rsquo;t expect yourself to be any different, but you can be different by learning, instead of sticking with a fixed mindset of: &ldquo;Man, I really don&rsquo;t know how to do this, I suck&hellip;..&rdquo; I also think that having a feeling of incompetence is a sign that you&rsquo;re being challenged, and I think it&rsquo;s important to embrace the challenge you&rsquo;re facing and tackle it head on, as a way to improve and grow your skills. I think when it comes to stuff like this, it matters more about how good you want to be, over how good you are. I definitely still struggle with this mindset, but I hope overtime I learn to fully accept imposter syndrome.</p>
