        <p>Python is one of the most popular languages in the world, and for good reason. It&rsquo;s extremely easy to write and understand, there are multiple libraries, and its good for many things like machine learning and data analysis. It&rsquo;s often suggested to newcomers in the Programming field because of how popular and simple it is, it was my first experience with programming in general. I don&rsquo;t regret starting with Python, I still write a bunch of mini scripts using the language, but I would much rather work with another language, because of a few issues that I have with Python. My first problem with Python is the fact that it&rsquo;s dynamically typed, which can lead to a bunch of errors as the program becomes larger due to variables being checked at runtime, although there are good arguments to both sides of the story. I prefer statically typed, regardless of the fact that I have to write a few more lines of code, it&rsquo;s just much more clearer for me. Another problem I have with Python is the fact that it uses whitespace for it&rsquo;s syntax, which makes the code harder for me to read, because you don&rsquo;t have curly braces to find where a function begins and ends, where the actions in a conditional statement are contained, etc. Final big problem I have with it, is that it&rsquo;s slow. Of course, it being slow doesn&rsquo;t matter too much as processors improve and overall hardware capabilities expand, but it&rsquo;s still a problem for older hardware. However, I can still see why the language is successful and why so many people use it, I still use it, although I would personally prefer using other languages when possible.</p>
