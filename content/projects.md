### Intro
I've built a wide array of projects over my time coding, specifically for myself, to make things that I do easier and configured to my tastes. These projects are from oldest to newest, showing my progress as a programmer.

# PGen

### Details:
* First Python project
* Created using TKinter
* Gets a random adjective and noun from a list, and they're randomly appended and returned at the bottom.
### Inspiration:
I wanted to make a program that randomly generated a strong password for a user, due to the fact that many people nowadays don't have the strongest password, and they end up reusing it multiple times, which leaves them vulnerable to massive damage when passwords and much more are leaked. PGen is meant to be simple, small, and good at what it does. 

# WaifuScraper

### Details:
* Python Project
* First time working with JSON data from a website
* Created using UrlLib
* When you initialize the script, it creates a folder where the images will be stored if it doesn't already exist. You input a that you want to look up, and amount of images, and then Python scrapes the website from newest to oldest. It checks if the image you're dowloading is already downloaded, and if it is, it moves onto the next image.
### Inspiration:
I love art and follow many different artists, but I don't have enough time to manually look their work up, so I wrote this script to automate that process of downloading art from my favorite artists. It was my first experience with webscraping, and it helped make my time on the computer even more efficient, due to the fact that it's fully automated after it receives 2 inputs.

# Nord Images

### Details:
* HTML/CSS Project
* Static webiste hosting high quality images with the Nord color theme.

### Inspiration:
Many people like to look for high quality wallpapers, so their workspace looks as good as possible. However, due to the lack of high quality images on the internet, many people often have to spend a ton of time looking for images, and then editing them to suit their tastes. So the Nord Images project aimed to do exactly that, by providing users multiple images edited with the Nord colorscheme, a popular Blue colorscheme with many enthusiasts. The images provided also included links to original posts so the user could see the original artist/photographer.

### Details:
* Python Project
* Discord Bot with a wide arrange of utilites
* Includes a few APIs for sending images
* Includes SQLite integration for message logs and moderation functions
### Inspiration:
Discord is one of the main places where I talk, and I love the bots that other people make, so I decided to make my own personal bot for me and my friends. The bot has a wide arrange of utilities, like moderation commands, logging message deletion, profile changes, a SQLite database for these utilities, and much more. It has a built in support for multiple websites, where it gets images or random phrases and sends them back to the user, which is all for fun and enjoyment. It took a lot of effort and time, but the outcome of the project was pleasing to see.

# Hielo Caluculator
### CLI

### GUI
[![HieloGUI](https://i.postimg.cc/L52Cg8Kt/hielogui.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Q9YkRsMC)
### Details:
* C# Project
* CLI and GUI Calculator with trigometric conversions, basic functionality, and unit conversions + more
* Uses Decimal type numbers for extremely precise calculations, more precise than floats or doubles
* GUI Made with Avalonia Framework for cross-platform synergy
### Inspriation:
I couldn't find a CLI Calculator that I liked and had functions for trigonometry and much more, so I made my own. It has lots of functions and it's extremely simple to use, since it's setup with an enumeration menu, making the process extremely easy to use and understand. Due to the limitations that floats and doubles have, as in they're not as precise as they should be, I decided to use the Decimal type, which allows for 64 bit numbers, meaning the caluculations the calucator will do are as precise as possible. The GUI is clean and simple, and all the buttons are in the usual spot that they should be in, which gives the user the freedom to choose, depending on their preference of GUI or CLI.


# Plastico

### Details:
* C# Project
* Todo List with SQLite Database and Notification support written in C++

### Inspiration:
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many people had to switch to online school, and due to the nature of online school, it led to many people easily being prone to distractions or procrastination, which is what this Todo List aims to get rid of. Plastico aims to improve the user's speed in doing tasks by being easy to use, and providing hourly notifications to the user, helping them stay on track. 

# Conclusion:
I've put my soul into these projects, and I've tried to make them the best they can be. I developed these apps to make life easier for myself, and for the people that use these projects. I'm extremely proud of how far I've come from when I started coding, and I hope I continue to get better and better at this.
