### Intro
I've built a wide array of projects over my time coding, specifically for myself, to make things that I do easier and configured to my tastes. These projects are from oldest to newest, showing my progress as a programmer.

# PGen

### Details:
* First Python project
* Created using TKinter
* Gets a random adjective and noun from a list, and they're randomly appended and returned at the bottom.
### Inspiration:
I wanted to make a program that randomly generated a strong password for a user, due to the fact that many people nowadays don't have the strongest password, and they end up reusing it multiple times, which leaves them vulnerable to massive damage when passwords and much more are leaked. PGen is meant to be simple, small, and good at what it does. 

# WaifuScraper

### Details:
* Python Project
* First time working with JSON data from a website
* Created using UrlLib
* When you initialize the script, it creates a folder where the images will be stored if it doesn't already exist. You input a that you want to look up, and amount of images, and then Python scrapes the website from newest to oldest. It checks if the image you're dowloading is already downloaded, and if it is, it moves onto the next image.
### Inspiration:
I love art and follow many different artists, but I don't have enough time to manually look their work up, so I wrote this script to automate that process of downloading art from my favorite artists. It was my first experience with webscraping, and it helped make my time on the computer even more efficient, due to the fact that it's fully automated after it receives 2 inputs.

# Weedy

### Details:
* Python Project
* Discord Bot with a wide arrange of utilites
* Includes a few APIs for sending images
* Includes SQLite integration for message logs and moderation functions
### Inspiration:
Discord is one of the main places where I talk, and I love the bots that other people make, so I decided to make my own personal bot for me and my friends. The bot has a wide arrange of utilities, like moderation commands, logging message deletion, profile changes, a SQLite database for these utilities, and much more. It has a built in support for multiple websites, where it gets images or random phrases and sends them back to the user, which is all for fun and enjoyment. It took a lot of effort and time, but the outcome of the project was pleasing to see.
