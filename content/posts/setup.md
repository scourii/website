I've been using Linux for over a year, and one of the things I've done gradually overtime is working on my workflow, and customizing everything with a colorscheme and adding keybinds for special things, and I feel like I've gotten to a point where I have all that I could want out of a workflow. I use a Tiling Window Manager called HerbstluftWM, and it's an amazing Window Manager, the config file is super easy to modify, and it's very light and has lots of neat customization options. It comes with the option to be a Tiling window manager, and a floating window manager, which is great because I can alternate between what I want to use and everything, it's super handy. I use this notification daemon called Dunst, and it's also extremely light and it looks fine, with the configuration file I have for it. I use a pinkish light theme that I really like, it looks really pretty and it's easy on the eyes for me, since I usually use my laptop at night and have no issues with eye strain and whatnot. I'm not a big fan of dark themes personally, so I'm using a light theme instead. My bar is lemonbar, which is just a bar that shows the output of files, and I have information on the time, the music I'm listening to, amount of RAM I'm using, volume percentage, internet name, and battery percentage. I wrote a script that hides it though, since it takes up space that I could use on something else, and the information that it provides is pretty unimportant to me most of the time. I use this application launcher called Rofi, for a few things, like opening apps, a powermenu, and an alt tab menu to switch to a different program. I've included a few videos/pictures of me using my laptop, and I'm really happy with how it looks and works.
