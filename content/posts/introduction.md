Heya, welcome to my Blog! My name is Scouri, but I also go by SugarBlank or Bryan, whatever name works for me. I'm not the most social person, I don't really like talking or being around people, and I prefer minding my own business. I like doing a lot of stuff, I like cooking, computer stuff, music, astronomy, gardening, anime, graphic design, art, reading, video games, and a bunch of other stuff. My favorite programming language is either C# or C++, and my least favorite language would probably be Python. My top 3 games are Final Fantasy IX, NieR Replicant, and NieR Automata. Some of the things I would like to try out would be Skiing, Snowboarding, Tennis, learning the Saxophone and Piano, learning about how hardware works, and learning how shit like a car engine works. This Blog is just a way for me to say my opinions on any topic that I feel like writing about, not just tech, pretty much a personal diary. I think it would be neat to check this out in the future, and see how my thoughts about X topic has changed or stayed the same, idk. I'm not going to update it everyday, I'll only do it when I have something to write about, but yeah, this exists.
