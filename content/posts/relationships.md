Many people usually end up feeling really bad when the one they confess to end up rejecting them in a relationship. While I can see why people feel upset when they get rejected, I prefer to look at the bright side. Usually when one gets turned down, their relationship hardly changes from what I've seen, they continue being good friends. I feel like many people nowadays value being in a relationship more than simply being friends with someone, which is something I personally disagree with. When you have good friends, you can always count on them to give you advice, support you, and give you a shoulder to lean on. This is pretty much the same thing a relationship is, just without the sexual things, which isn't and shouldn't be the main reason for a relationship. Being upset about being rejected makes sense, but taking the initiative and being honest is something to always feel proud of.
