Hi, I'm Bryan/SugarBlank.
I'm a hardworking 15 year old programmer. I'm extremely passionate about programming, and learning as a whole. I'm extremely hard working, and I never give up when something is difficult. I love to learn and try new things all the time, regardless of my initial thoughts on the subject.
